### The Blunder  
  
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.  
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.  
  
***Input Format***  
The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:  
  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12893/1443817108-adc2235c81-1.png)  
  
***Note:*** Salary is measured in dollars per month and its value is < 10^5.
**Solution**  
``` sql
	SELECT CEIL(AVG(salary) - AVG(REPLACE(salary, '0', ''))) FROM employees;
```
  
  
  
### Top Earners  
  
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary*months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2-space-separated integers.  
  
***Input Format***  
The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:   
  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19629/1458557872-4396838885-ScreenShot2016-03-21at4.27.13PM.png)  
  
where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary. 
**Solution** 
``` sql 
	select max(months * salary), count(months * salary) from Employee where (months * salary) = (select max(months * salary) from Employee);
```
  
  
  
### Weather Observation Station 2  
  
Query the following two values from the STATION table:  
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.  
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.  
  
***Input Format***  
The STATION table is described as follows:  
  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)  
  
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
**Solution**  
``` sql
	SELECT (ROUND(SUM(lat_n), 2) || ' ' || ROUND(SUM(long_w), 2)) FROM station;
```
  
  
  
### Weather Observation Station 13

```
  
  
  
### Weather Observation Station 18  
  
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.  
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).  
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).  
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).  
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).  
  
Query the [Manhattan Distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places. 
**Solution** 
``` sql
	SELECT ROUND(ABS(a - c) + ABS(b - d), 4) FROM (
    SELECT MIN(lat_n) AS a, MIN(long_w) AS b, MAX(lat_n) AS c, MAX(long_w) AS d FROM station);
```
  
  
  
### Weather Observation Station 19  
  
Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.   
(a,b) - the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N)  
(c,d) - the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.  
  
Query the [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.
**Solution**  
```sql
	SELECT ROUND (SQRT((a - b) * (a - b) + (c - d) * (c - d)), 4) FROM (
    SELECT MIN(lat_n) AS a, MAX(lat_n) AS b, MIN(long_w) AS c, MAX(long_w) AS d FROM station);
```
